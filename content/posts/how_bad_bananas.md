The first step in order to change is to realize the need for change. Thinking about carbon footprint for a little while,  I started making minute changes last year largely based on randomly gathered ideas I had about what is carbon efficient or not.

To progress further, I needed data. A good friend told me about this book  *How bad are bananas*  that comprises a hundred different items and their footprints. It turns out only some of my ideas were correct, and that my correctness was not correlated with my confidence level; I got surprised.

This is a must-read to whom want to dive a little bit deeper in the world of carbon footprint, and will provide easy yet powerful steps to reduce one energy consumption.

As for me, I realize that my random small efforts help, but a more thought-about plan would probably bring better results. Below are a couple of noteworthy information that will be extended in the future.

***

* Base unit is carbon dioxide equivalent CO2e than encompass all greenhouse gas and normalize their impact
* UK average 13tons/Co2e/person/year
  * Author propose to reduce to 10tons as need only small effort and would make situation better for the planet

* My current small efforts
  * Shower every other day
  * Commute by bike and public transportation
  * I had no car until 2019
  * No beef or lamb
  * Reduce long distance transport
  * Avoid plane where possible
  * Use single-blade metal only razor blade
  * No packaging for soap and shampoo
  * Planned  additional ones
    * Low car use, maybe 3000miles per year
    * Reduce dairy, no milk in coffee, oat milk in tea
    * Measure and offset carbon footprint of car, train and plane
    * Offset by paying for charity planting trees

* Notes
  * This book is about carbon footprint only, there are many more dimensions when making life choice including pollution, efforts needed and other side-effects
  * ME --> It is all about reducing the day-to-day consumption as exceptional events are both very hard to quantify and rare

* Food
  * Banana actually quite good at 480g Co2e/kg, no packaging, little farming energy, good nutritional content
  * Apple avg. 550g Co2e/kg - 60g for local seasonal, 271g  UK apple, 185g New Zealand!
  * Fresh tomatoes in season 500g Co2e/kg but 20kgs Co2e/kg not in season!
  * Strawberries 600g Co2e/kg in season, 2.7kgs Co2e/kg otherwise
  * Orange 500g/kg but juice 3kgs Co2e/kg
  * Rice plantations emits methane, 20x more carbon footprint than potatoes
  * Only yearly available fresh fruit not grown artificially: bananas, apple, orange, pineapple
  * Conclusion is eat local and in season!

* Electronics
  * Small TV 1hr/day 32kgs Co2e per year, not much
  * ME --> Apple laptop 2015 was 710kgs Co2e, 2019 model is 222kgs Co2e
  * Personal laptop 2hours per day about 200kgs Co2e per year if 2015 laptop kept 4 years
  * Plug power meter is only about Â£10, need to get one for more precise measurements

* Hot drinks
  * Coffee/tea + water 40g Co2e
  * Coffee/tea + Milk 70g Co2e
  * Large cappuccino 235g Co2e

* Nappies 550kg Co2e per child, washing reusable nappies not better for carbon
* Plastic bags do not matter - 5bags/week for a year is equivalent to 1 cheeseburger or about 15kms in a car, about 2.5kgs Co2e

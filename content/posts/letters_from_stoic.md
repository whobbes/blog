Seneca, roman philosopher, wrote a series of letters towards the end of his life. They present his teachings
often in the form of starting on an example and extracting a bit of wisdom out of it. The book includes
124 of such letters and are surprisingly witty and modern for such an old text. The author indeed ponders
about the use of the latest gadgets, stand against all forms of slavery and for equality and considers if being vegetarian is a good idea. It reminds us that the fundamental of human life do not change so fast and are well worth exploring.

* The aim is not to be in isolation, social relations are better, but one should start by being self-reliant so one can lose everything - relations, money, possession, status - and still be strong and contented
* One need to ignore many things in life to focus on a few important ones, Seneca propose to ignore possessions, money, entertainment
* Living in easy situation makes us weak, need to go for self-inflicted pain to learn to live with it e.g. cold shower, fasting, eating only bread, sleeping on floor
* Philosophers should not wear something different or be visually different, only the person and their action make the difference
* No need for frivolous life and extravagant possession (such as carved ceilings or water taps made of silver)

Science fiction book by John C Wright. The universe and postulate are very interesting the storyline a bit less so. Good but not great.

The one interesting thing about the universe is that AR/VR is pushed to the max in that the vision, emotional response and all sense can be altered or programmed in certain way. Each person have filters that can be activated in order to create compatibility with different types of being using very different means of communication. This makes for a reality with lots of intricate levels differing and merging together.

The plot itself is about a chosen one who is very clever, special, and act carelessly but it is ok as he is very clever. I found this quite tiresome throughout the unfolding story which does not leave much space for surprise. A few cool moments like the use of the battle of logic at the tribunal are clich√© but fun to go through.
